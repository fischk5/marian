# Achieve your mission with clarity  
  
Tetheros is a collaboration platform that empowers dynamic teams to align their effort and impact.  
  
**Efficiency is meaningless if the impact doesn't matter**  
  
We desire to help teams strategically collaborate on meaningful work.  
  
## Champion your purpose  

Connect every task, goal, and KPI directly to your mission. Automatically see how well any item is aligned (or misaligned) with your strategy.

***Eliminate busywork that isn't moving the mission forward.***  
  
## Designed for one team, or a team of teams  
 
Built for dynamic teams to work together, whether you're an enterprise, startup, consultant, or need to organize your side hustle.

***Coordinate your team's work, communications, and strategies in one place***  
  
## Approach work your way  
  
It is hard to strategically collaborate on meaningful work. Organize your work to fit your style without sacrificing the ability to align your efforts with other teams.

***Tetheros supports a growing ecosystem of frameworks for work, strategy, planning and communication.***
