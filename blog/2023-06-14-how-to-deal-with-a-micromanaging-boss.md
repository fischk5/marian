Micromanaging bosses suck the life out of work.  
<!--truncate-->
  
Not only does the overbearing nature of a micromanager constantly put you on edge, it also feels like you’re trying to do the job *their* way instead of yours.  As a well-trained, competent worker you’re forced to playing a guessing game instead of thoughtfully accomplishing things your way.  
  
**You cannot fix a bad boss**, but you can learn to deal with them more effectively to create space for yourself.  In this post we’ll cover:  
- Why some good bosses micromanage  
- Sinister signs of manipulation to look out for  
- Strategies for taking back control  
  
## Micromanagement is normal and healthy… for a little bit  
  
Changing jobs exposes you to a new culture, status quo, tools, and maybe most importantly - a new boss.  
  
A lot happens in your first few weeks.  While your team gets to know you, you’re busy swimming upstream in projects, vernacular, inside jokes, and [complex political webs](/blog/the-rebels-guide-to-office-politics).  How you fare will establish how much your boss trusts you, which forms the basis for your autonomy.   
  
The *micromanagement danger zone* occurs at the end of your training period.  Will the boss push you from the nest to see if you can fly?  Hopefully, yes.  But some bosses don’t know any better and continue treating you like you’re training long after you’re fully indoctrinated.  
  
This form of micromanagement is accidental and well-meaning; your boss doesn’t know how to take the training wheels off and unleash you into the workplace.  
  
Pay close attention to this period of time - they may not realize you’re ready to take the wheel (or might not have much experience leading others).  
  
**If your boss is harmlessly micromanaging your work because they aren’t aware you’re ready, create space for yourself with thoughtful dialog that indicates you’re ready to try a new work style.**  
  
For example, ask to shift from collaboration (a.k.a. *hovering*) to review, where you operate independently then review the work with the boss later in the day or week. Over time, space these “reviews” further out until your boss realizes they aren’t necessary.  Your consistent, high-quality work will force your boss to improve your autonomy.  
  
After all, they only hovered because they didn’t know any better and you’ve quietly reprogrammed their habits to create space.  
  
Some bosses accidentally micromanage because they’re operators who were promoted to managers.  They are victims of the [Peter Principle](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/peter-principle/): being promoted until they reached their area of incompetency.  Being a good quarterback doesn’t mean you’re automatically a good coach.  
  
Bosses with these characteristics need training.  A proven way to navigate these types is to earn their trust over time - purposefully doing things their way really well - until they loosen their grip on your style.  Some personalities never come around or grow, but well-meaning bosses who understand the operations well (because they were also really good at it) will come to appreciate your efforts once they convince themselves you’re capable and competent.  
  
The key ingredient to autonomy is trust.  
  
Well-meaning micromanagers are usually more worried about the overall results reflecting poorly on them than they are about your specific abilities.  Stack up a few wins *for them*, continuously build trust, and you should see higher levels of autonomy over time.  
  
## Signs your boss actually enjoys manipulating you (and how to counter them) 
  
Bad bosses usually come with reputations.  Be careful not to assume a bad reputation is automatically the truth or you'll only ever see their bad side when they don't deserve it.  
  
Those aren’t the bosses we’re talking about here.  
  
Intentional micromanagers are the types of people that suffocate morale and create employment exoduses from their treatment of teams.  They’re usually experienced, entrenched in the status quo, protected by people in power, and a high performer or highly neurotic.  
  
Here are the signs to look out for:  
  
### Talking poorly about other people’s work  
  
Being overly critical of other people’s work isn’t a good look in the first place, but when your boss starts criticizing other people’s work unfairly when they aren’t around… it’s not a good look.  
  
Be on guard because they’re **probably criticizing your work** when you aren’t present too.  Bosses like these usually have unrealistic standards which come from a few places:  
- Unbearable pressure from *their* boss, which cascades to you  
- They are a high performer, and expect the same from anyone they lead *to a fault*  
- Anxiety or neuroticism makes them extremely worried about anything less than perfection  
  
**How to counter it:** Stand up for others when they aren’t there.  
  
One of the most powerful ways to build someone’s reputation is to talk good about them behind their back.  When your boss negatively highlights others, counter with silver linings and other worthy praise.  Or respectfully disagree and allow a crucial conversation to occur.    
  
Build up the reputation of people who aren’t there to resist the morale drain that comes when your boss resents your team.  

### Making themselves a large dependency for your work  
  
Some bosses maintain control by forcing you to go through them for approvals, information, additional requirements, and decisions.  
  
On the surface, these habits appear like your well-meaning leader didn’t give you enough, but they’re actually gatekeeping progress and productivity.  They’re giving you room to operate as long as the road to completion comes through their office.  
  
**How to counter it:** Improve your skills, understanding, and internal network.  
  
When their gate is related to a specific skill you don’t have, learn it.  If you can’t learn it, become close with people that are already good at it.  When you circumvent your boss to go directly to someone else for help, you’ll appear proactive and efficient while also loosening the titanic grip on your autonomy.  
  
### Selectively delegating work  
  
If your boss is giving you space, but you don’t feel like you’re doing valuable work, they may be controlling you by reducing the impact you’re able to make.  
  
Everything they’re giving you is relatively unimportant, or tasks they have strong influence over.  Anything strategic or critical stays with them or given to someone they trust more.  
  
They selectively delegate items that allow them to reverse-micromanage you because keeping you busy and out of their hair is more important to them than the work.  
  
**How to counter it:** Demonstrate extreme ownership.  
  
Jocko Willink [demonstrates the idea of *extreme ownership* in a TED talk](https://youtu.be/ljqra3BcqWM) with the example of a military operation gone wrong.  When leadership called him up to discuss the events, he took full responsibility for the actions and mistakes of anyone underneath him.  
  
Taking deep responsibility for the work in front of you broadcasts a powerful message to your boss: you take accountability seriously, and anything in front of you will be done to the highest level.  Your micromanaging boss will have no choice but to see you as capable of high-value work.  
  
If they don’t, start polishing up your resume.    
  
### False autonomy laced with unsolicited advice  
  
Your boss gives you plenty of tasks and plenty of space to work on them, but tactfully checks in to see if you’re doing things their way.  In fact, their approach to giving advice is so subtle, you don’t realize you’ve been working to please them and often look past your own ideas to incorporate theirs.  
  
**How to counter it:** Confident dialog.  
  
Call out their behavior in a respectful, productive way.  If you use the word “micromanage” in this discussion it presents them with a label they don’t want to be stuck with.  
  
The exact phase you use depends on your dialog skills, your relationship with the boss, and the context you discuss it in.  Choose carefully.  
  
### Gaslighting attempts at productive dialog  
  
The most extreme form of micromanagement comes when your boss not only denies their own behavior, they blame you for it.  Over time, morale drops, growth stops, and you’re left questioning your own judgment about anything work-related.  
  
Gaslighting is a serious problem because it’s impossible to have productive dialog.  Your boss simply cannot see their own shortcomings because they’re too busy pointing out the faults in everyone else while playing dirty politics.  
  
**How to counter it:** Drown them in details or get out.  
  
Fight fire with fire.  If your boss is overbearing, manipulative, and undermining your effectiveness then let them have their way.  Give them every juicy detail about every little thing you’re working on.  
  
They want status updates?  Give them more than they bargained for.  Unhappy with your deadline?  Turn in unfinished work.  If they insist on being engaged in every single part of your work, overwhelm them until they back off.  
  
Don’t take part in a losing battle, though.  If they’re beyond reforming and you’ve tried everything within reason to be a productive member of the team, update your resume and start looking for new opportunities.
