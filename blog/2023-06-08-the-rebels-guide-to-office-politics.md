If you want to make a difference in the world, learning the game of office politics is your best chance.
<!--truncate-->

The term “office politics” has a negative connotation, but only because it’s easier to associate it with dirty play.  People manipulating others to do their bidding, or backstabbing someone else in an agreement.  Characters like Frank Underwood and Richard Nixon often come to mind during conversations about corrupt politics, but there’s more to the story.

Office politics are a game like any other, and they exist for one simple reason: a group of people has to decide how to use a pool of limited resources.  They are the method by which teams navigate conversations and decisions about time, budgets, skills, and people.

And if you’re not actively developing your skills at this game, you will not have a strong voice in how those resources are used.

In this guide, we’ll cover the basics of the political game, including a few ways you can improve your ability to play it.


## Everyone is involved in office politics  
One of the extremely limited resources teams have to make decisions about is its people.

On a construction site, it may seem like the multi-million dollar equipment would be the most expensive thing around, but talk to any foreman or construction owner and they’ll tell you the workforce costs more per day to have in operation than anything else.  
  
The same is true in other workplaces too, especially white-collar, knowledge-worker jobs.  Everyone, including the boss, is a resource to the company which means everyone is impacted by the results of political games.  
  
The most skilled players know how to read the room and play their hand.  The worst players don’t realize they’re even playing, with some denying they are involved in politics in any way at all.  
  
It matters because the only way to fight for what is right and good is to learn how to navigate office politics better than people with bad intentions (or bad leaders).  If you decide not to participate, you will be played instead.  
  
## Every organization has two structures
Decisions are made by players with high influence.  Influence is based on their position in the company structures, which every company has two:  
- Reporting structure (paper)  
- Power structure (unwritten)  
  
Influence - the ability for someone to steer decisions in their favor - is based more on the unwritten dynamics of the power structure than where someone ranks in the official company hierarchy.  People with high influence are often long-standing members of the organization that have earned trust from others and have primary control over an important domain.  They aren’t always in an official leadership position, and may not even use the influence they have (or realize how powerful they actually are).  
  
Identify players with high influence by:
1. Asking about how decisions were made
1. Attending company events and learning who you’re working with
1. Paying attention to people who effectively delegate work and projects  
  
Over time, you’ll map the unwritten power structure, which leads to the next phase of office politics.
  
## Proximity to influence creates influence  
  
Gaining proximity to people with great influence creates opportunities in the workplace.  It’s also a great way to build your own influence.

The people you know, especially at work, determines what you get to do.  Leaders are more willing to engage people they know and trust when they need help.  Building an authentic relationship with them puts you on their short list.

Being in the inner circle also increases your odds of knowing about new opportunities as they arise.  These opportunities matter because what you get to do determines what you get to learn, and knowledge and growth is the foundation of success and impact.

Merit is important, but influence can open doors your skills can’t.

## 6 ways to improve your political savviness  
  
The only way to fight for what is right and good is to learn how to play the political game better than people with opposing beliefs about your resources.

Here are some unspoken strategies for gaining an advantage and developing your influence without compromising your character:
  
### 1. See yourself as others see you  
Your perception matters more than your intentions for building trust and using influence.  If you lack charisma, your best efforts to make change will be ignored.

Strive to see how you make others feel when they’re around you or working with you.  Improve this by:

**Asking for feedback.**  Have courage and ask the hard questions of others about your own habits.  When you receive criticism, respond only with “thank you.”

**Watching for non-verbal cues.**  Most communication is unspoken.  It is easy to pay attention to the loudmouth in the meetings or the emotional outbursts, but they are often in less control than the quiet leaders pulling the strings.  Study how people engage with others without words: who do people look to for approval during a pitch?  Who isn’t at the meeting?

**Studying your communication patterns.**  Are you prompt?  Concise?  Are people listening to what you have to say, or are you ignored for some reason?  If you cannot communicate well with others you will never build a reputation or body of influence.  Adopt new skills and styles to win the hearts and minds of those around you.  
  
### 2. Find out who is related to who  
A lot of teams are built on networks instead of merit.  Word travels quickly within a network, especially when connected to people of great influence.  Figure out who is connected to who, their history, and their roles.  Who gets things done?  Who can be a mentor or advocate?

Don’t interact with others only when you need something.  Your success depends on the support and alliance you have with others.

### 3. Always take the easy shots
Giving 10% more than others is a guaranteed way to build trust, especially when it’s easy.  Easy shots include:
Attending optional meetings
- Volunteering for company or coworker events
- Spending five minutes helping someone
- Sharing organized meeting minutes

Being engaged and taking advantage of the small, simple opportunities is a powerful way to increase your visibility and build influence because it expands your network and builds your reputation.

### 4. Focus on what gets measured
There are a lot of things you could be working on, but the business only inspects items that matter the most.

Invest 80% of your effort on work and strategies that are regularly discussed, reviewed, and measured by the business to be viewed as a high-impact individual or team.

### 5. Present yourself well
Being a polished individual means having an elegant style.  Your level of polish (or dullness) is noticed by others.  Build trust and favor by investing in your:
- Outfits: dress nicer than others, but not too much nicer.
- Attitude: lift others up, and don’t commiserate against the establishment with voices of minor influence
- Punctuality: never be late.

### 6. Learn what motivates others
There are four main things that motivate people:
Advancement
Individuality
Purpose
Madness

Spend time figuring out how to speak to others in their specific motivation language to build trust.  Trust creates opportunities.  The only way to get what you want is to find others and give them what they want.  Figure out what rules they like to follow and which they ignore.

Being politically savvy is a leadership skill.  You’re always in a position to build influence and reputation, regardless of title.

Will you be a fox, focused on your own needs?  Or will you be an owl, driven by purpose and organizational success?

The bureaucracy is run by people with large influence built over a long time, but they can be toppled by agents of change.  Learning to play the game is the only way to avoid being played by the old guard intent on protecting the status quo at the expense of the organization’s own growth.
