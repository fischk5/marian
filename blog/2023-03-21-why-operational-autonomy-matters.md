I‚Äôm frequently asked how Tetheros is different than the hundreds of other solutions out there.

And for a while, I wasn‚Äôt sure how to answer.

So I‚Äôm building a list of principles and outcomes Tetheros provides.  
  
Today I want to focus on **Operational Autonomy**.  
  
Companies like having one solution for efficiency and cost, especially for project management. This choice forces teams to ‚Äúwork a certain way‚Äù to appease corporate budgets and bureaucracy.  
  
For example, a software shop may require everyone to work in Jira, toward an Epic, with agile-based practices. This works fine... until those teams have to collaborate with others who don‚Äôt operate that way.  
  
The collaboration train comes off the rails while managers scramble to gather data, progress reports, and coordinate budgets.  
  
One size doesn't fit all when it comes to work habits. Different teams, - even different individuals on a team - prefer to work in different ways. How do you collaborate with someone using a different work style than yours?  
  
ü§Æ The typical answer usually involves **alignment meetings**  
  
ü•≥ Tetheros provides **workstreams**.  
  
Rather than forcing collaborating teams to use the same style of work (lists, boards, discussions), workstreams allow teams to tackle tasks in a style that suits them while reporting their overall progress to the rest of the team.  
  
Tetheros supports a growing catalog of ways to organize work because **autonomy in how you operate is necessary for strong collaboration**.  I‚Äôm adamant that bureaucracy shouldn‚Äôt force teams to work in ways that don‚Äôt complement their personalities and preferences.
