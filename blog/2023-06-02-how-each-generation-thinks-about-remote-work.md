Remote work affects each generation differently. That said there’s room for each generation to gain something from it. Remote work allows for flexibility not only for how different generations work but also for how each person works best.

## How remote work affects each generation
  
Some may ask why we should consider how each generation thinks about remote work. It greatly affects the whole population though, whether we want it to or not! It’s a way to better understand how generations act at work. Allowing remote work may make the workplace better for everyone and, perhaps, also the healthiest.  

That said there are also [reasons why we shouldn’t lean on generational lines too much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzfAOc4L6vQ&ab_channel=TEDxTalks). Factors from anomalies in every generation to allowing further divide between generations. Not everyone is as affected by the time in which they were born. experiences with remote work, no matter how they feel about the idea, 

### The Silent Generation [(Born 1928–1945)](https://www.parents.com/parenting/better-parenting/style/generation-names-and-years-a-cheat-sheet-for-parents/)  
  
The oldest generation in the workforce today is the silent generation - best known for being born in the time around the Great Depression. They know remote work exists but [they appreciate the personal touch](https://www.purdueglobal.edu/education-partnerships/generational-workforce-differences-infographic/), and they think that’s mainly done through in-person and on-paper interaction.  
  
### The Boomers (Born 1946–1964)  

They were born after World War II through 1964. They want to do things efficiently but also believe in paying one’s dues as one moves up in a company, which may lead to hesitation to allow working from home to the younger generations.  

### Generation X (Born 1965–1980)
They’re reading to implement remote work to a large extent if it’s valuable to the organization but also sees the value in allowing flexibility as they see different people working better in different ways.  

### Generation Y/Millenials (Born 1981–1996) 
The millennials who can work from home or believe they should be able to do a job from home don’t see a reason not to. They see the value of it and want to implement it wherever possible. They want to work for results and want to learn and grow and work on career development on the job.  

### Generation Z (Born 1997–2010)
They value independence and wants to work remotely as much as possible, they are a bit more self-taught, plus they can multi-task and work on multiple projects at once quite effectively working from anywhere.  

### Predictions for Generation Alpha (the babies and kids mostly under 10 years of age today)  

They will crave remote work though they will also want the coworking spaces to expand their network as they find community to a large extent and will find other ways of working if they can’t find a job that’s remote. Though they will also value the trades more than Y or Z. They will value coworking but mostly on their own terms.  
  
In the larger world of business, the business card will go the way of the dinosaur, and digital versions will become the norm, avoiding paper for most business-related interactions/transactions, though the organization of digital assets/communications/etc will become paramount in the workplace. Especially as people want to carry less paper as they work remotely and function through their contacts app on their phone and their digital files.  
  
As we look to the future of working it’s important for each organization to carefully consider how the business functions, the apps used by the company and how they can select systems that work the best for anyone at the company no matter how they prefer to work - whether on site or remote. 

## The effects of remote work on the workforce as whole  
  
Working remotely will lead to more organized and efficient workplaces as jobs allow for it. Even someone doing physical labor, in-person sales, or something else that can’t be remote can get all the information for their work on a device and get immediate feedback and scheduling, get their work recorded most effectively, and sent to the company digitally.  
  
Remote work is also safer in a number of scenarios, especially during snowy winters in some states or trying to find parking and walking downtown in busy cities among other scenarios.  

These are among the factors that affect every generation in nearly the same way. 

### Diving Deep on the Millenial Perspective

After talking with millennials, it seems like most who work on computers for their jobs prefer remote work, though many may not be able to rule out onsite work though.  

What we’ve found is that remote work environment tends to mean a couple of things that millennials have come to value. It means that they don’t want to waste time, or gas money for that matter, commuting. Many have nicer spots to work if they can work remotely - say a private, quiet home office, where they may have their pet sitting at their feet, or a homey coffee shop where they can interact with their own community, and have a change of scenery and a chance at even more inspiration.  
  
Millennials to a certain extent note that often allowing remote work means an employer may trust them more.  
  
They don’t see “work” as your butt being in your seat in your cubicle, instead, the employer sees “work” as the actual results delivered, which is where many could argue the value is as long as the same quality can be produced. Sometimes employers even expect more work to be done while working from home, citing that there may be fewer distractions like coworkers to distract employees from work.  
  
It may also show respect for employees having a life outside of work and allowing them to work odd hours to a large extent if the employee wants that, say for parents needing to pick up kids from school, or get to a dental appointment for just an hour.  
  
Practically from what some millennials have experienced, it tends to mean that a company is more organized as a whole too. They don’t have piles of paperwork around or rooms full of filing cabinets of said paperwork, which means you have to be in the office to access it.
  
They have good equipment to a large extent as well - better phone systems if any are needed at all, better computers, communication systems, and program subscriptions to allow employees to not only work more effectively but do their work from wherever.

Remote work lends itself to more trust building, better work/life balance, better use of technology, and more safety, for millennials and every other generation.  
  
Each generation has a different outlook on remote work - no doubt about it. They could all benefit from it though, especially if it’s well implemented and flexibility in workplace is considered, allowing each generation to choose how they work best. It’s also helpful to know the values that have inspired each generations outlooks though as it sheds light on why they’ve preferred each style and it’s benefits.
