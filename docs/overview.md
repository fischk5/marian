[**Tetheros**](https://tetheros.com) is a cloud-based collaboration platform for teams that combines project management, communication, and strategic planning to improve teamwork without creating unnecessary paperwork.
  
Tetheros helps you answer the question, "why" for your teammates and leaders by highlighting context and exposing the big picture within the product.  
  
Every task, board, list, and goal can be connected, or "tethered", to a specific project.  Tetheros doesn't require this, and you won't miss out on any of the powerful alignment features if your team doesn't formally work on projects.  
  
Some of the key features of Tetheros include:  
- **Projects.** Align workstreams and goals with the big picture.   
- **Workstreams.** Manage tasks in a growing catalog of different styles.   
- **Goal Management.** Track KPIs and set goals for the things that matter.
- **Communication Feed.** Create content for your team in a social inspired feed.   
  
Tetheros promotes alignment.   
  
The platform can't replace a broken culture, but it can create an environment where it's easy to do the right thing.  There is a massive difference between "doing things right" and "doing the right thing".  Tetheros helps nudge your team toward the right thing without much effort.

Tetheros supports five key outcomes:  
  
### 1. Extreme Visibility  
  
Tetheros prioritizes understanding progress and purpose.  
  
This includes progress of tasks, projects, goals, workloads, assignments and more.  Highlighting progress creates transparency, which drives trust.  Clear work removes misunderstandings and keeps everyone on the same page.  
  
Visibility also supports better accountability within a team by clarifying responsibilities and spotlighting risks and raising awareness of everyone's achievements.  The easier it is for your team to understand where you are, the better your decisions will be about what to do next.  
  
Strong decision making leads to more wins, which improves morale, which drives meaningful collaboration.
  
### 2. Apparency  
  
Teams don't need a tool - they need the benefits created by the tool.  Tetheros competitors focus on flexibility and automation plugins to the point of ridiculousness.  Some tools even require formal training and certifications to understand and use, which wastes time and resources.  
  
Tetheros is different.  
  
Instead of focusing on plugins and pedigree, Tetheros is designed for intuition.  Some elements of the platform are more restrictive to provide an intuitive experience so you don't have to spend any more time in the product than necessary.  
  
Tetheros cuts the fluff to give your team a leaner, more productive experience.  
  
### 3. Operational Autonomy  
  
One size doesn't fit all when it comes to work habits.  
  
Different teams, - even different individuals on a team - prefer to work in different ways.  How do you collaborate with someone using a different work style than yours?  The traditional answer usually involves alignment meetings.  
  
Tetheros seeks to solve that with workstreams.  
  
Rather than forcing collaborating teams to use the same style of work (lists, boards, discussions), workstreams allow you to tackle tasks in a style that suits you, while reporting your overall progress to the rest of the team.  
  
Tetheros supports a growing catalog of ways to organize work because autonomy in the way you operate is necessary for strong collaboration.

Never allow bureaucracy to force you to work in ways that don't compliment your team's personality and preferences.
  
### 4. Meaningful Context  
  
The most effective way to motivate your team is making sure they understand how their work fits into the bigger picture.  
  
Tetheros was built to answer the question "why" when interacting with any task, goal, project, or communication.  By creating context directly in the platform, teammates can quickly understand background, scope, and purpose of their work.  It unleashes their ability to think critically about how to solve something for a purpose.  
  
Context improves alignment by creating a bridge across everyone's understanding of the work's priority, purpose, and progress.
  
### 5. Futurology  
  
Measuring success shouldn't be left to the stars.  
  
Tetheros helps you create a strategic roadmap for managing the outcomes of your work.  Instead of endlessly moving tasks into an arbitrary column and hoping you've done enough for the project, Tetheros gives you tools for setting and measuring goals.  
  
Tools in the platform clarify where you're going.  
  
Strong leadership requires a north star, and Tetheros' evolving catalog of tools powers creating objectives and specific outcomes that can be shared across every project and workstream for a given initiative.
