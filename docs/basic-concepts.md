# Basic Concepts  

## Who is Tetheros for?
Tetheros is a **modern collaboration platform** for teams, or teams of teams, that value **clarity and alignment** in their work.  
  
Use the platform to:  
- Create and manage work with checklists or kanban boards  
- Set aggressive and measurable goals  
- Manage and measure key performance indicators  
- Build short and long-term strategies  
  
Tetheros was built to make it easy to work on the right things by providing a clear line-of-sight to your team's underlying purpose.

## Workspace  
`Workspaces` represent a collection of related efforts.  The most common ways to use a workspace include:  
- Standalone projects 
- Day-to-day team operations  
- Events, like a gala, conference, or meetup  

Everything you do in Tetheros takes place in a `workspace`.    

## Tasks  
Tasks represent the smallest body of work in Tetheros.  
  
They belong to lists and boards.
