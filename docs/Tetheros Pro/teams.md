# Teams
  
*Last updated: July, 18 2023* 
  
Teams are a group of users with access to one or more workspaces and assigned a role.  
  
### User permissions  
  
The access a user has in your network depends on what permissions their roles give them and what access their teams give them.  
  
**Roles** control *what* a user can do in a workspace or network.  
  
**Teams** control *where* the user can exercise their permissions.  
  
A team (or user) is assigned a **role** to control what permissions they have.

### Create a new team  
  
Go to the teams tab of the Users & Teams page of the network to manage all teams in your network.  Clicking `Create Team` will open the wizard from which you can add a new team to the network:

Every team needs:  
- **Name**: how the team is referenced throughout the network  
- **Team Members**: users to populate the team  
- **Workspaces**: workspaces that users on the team will have access to  
- **Role**: the permissions anyone on the team will have *in the selected workspaces*
  
<br/><br/>  
  

### Update or remove a team  
  
From the Teams tab of the Users & Teams page, you can rename the team by clicking directly on the team name and typing a new name.  Use the menu on the top right of a team's panel to Delete the team if you no longer need it.  This will immediately drop access to any workspaces the user's had through this team.  Anyone in the network who is not on a team when it is removed will remain in the network, but may not have access to any workspaces or network resources.  
  
You can also update a team's role, workspace access, or users from this panel.

*Removing a team does not remove or update any user's network membership.  Users need to be manually removed from a network through the Users panel*
