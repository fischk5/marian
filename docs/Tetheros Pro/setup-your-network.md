# Initial Network Setup
  
*Last updated: July, 18 2023 * 
  
Congratulations and welcome to Tetheros Pro!  Your account now has a **network** from which you will manage your team, workspaces, and billing.  

### Getting started  
   
Select `Begin Setup` from the sidebar on the home page, or navigate to [`https://tetheros.com/network/`](https://tetheros.com/network/):

<br/><br/>  

### Name your network  
  
Your network name typically represents your **organization**.  It does not have to be unique, but the `slug` does:  
  
![Choose a network name](https://storage.googleapis.com/tetheros-public/marian/pro-initial-setup-network-name.jpg)  
  
Tetheros will auto-build a slug based on the network name.  You will have to create a different slug if that one is not available.  The slug will be used to navigate to your network after it has been set up.  It must be unique throughout Tetheros.

### Explore the network management panel  
  
After your network is created and a unique slug is chosen, you will be redirected to the network management page for your organization.
