## Sidebar improvements  

The workspace sidebar now self-organizes according to projects, workstreams and views to reduce clutter and provide better context.  

[![Sidebar](../assets/v026-sidebar-new.png)](../assets/v026-sidebar-new.png)  
  
Expand projects to see all related workstreams, or create a new workstream independent of a project.  

## Bugs   
- Fixed error that prevented the "wrong password" snackbar from appearing during a failed login attempt
